# DraftSmith

Drafsmith is a modern note-taking and task management system built with a focus
on performance, type safety, and flexibility. It allows you to organize your
thoughts, tasks and knowledge in a hierarchical structure, whilst maintaining
relationships between different pieces of information through tags and parent-child
relationships.

Most importantly, DraftSmith is hackable! It allows both client side scripting
in JavaScript with no HTML sanitisation and server side scripting in [Rhai](https://rhai.rs/)
(with built-in functions directly from the server). This flexibility makes a
great thinking space to tinker with ideas and automate workflows.

See the [documentation](https://draftsmith.github.io/draftsmith_docs) for more information.
